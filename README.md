### Introduction
Thanks for taking time to go through this. 

I have no idea what I'm doing. 

### File Structure 
```
WAD2_project
	\root
		\css
		\images
		\pages
			\data
				community_service_posts.json
			admin.html
			sponsor.html
			student.html
		\scripts
			index.js
			student_card_container.js
		index.html
	hello.html
```

`community_service_posts.json` is fake data generated by chatGPT
`student_card_container.js` is the logic behind `student.html`
`index.html` login can go other page by submitting anything
